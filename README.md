A complete port of [openai/gym](https://github.com/openai/gym) to C#.<br>
** WORK IN PROGRESS ** 

##### openai/gym
OpenAI Gym is a toolkit for developing and comparing reinforcement learning algorithms. This is the gym open-source library, which gives you access to a standardized set of environments.

## Installation
```sh
### For gym's abstract classes for RL, install:
PM> Install-Package Gym.NET

### For implemented environments, install:
PM> Install-Package Gym.NET.Environments
```

## Example
The following example runs and renders cartpole-v1 environment.
```C#
using NumSharp;
using SixLabors.ImageSharp;
using Gym.Environments;
using Gym.Environments.Envs.Classic;
using Gym.Rendering.WinForm;

CartPoleEnv cp = new CartPoleEnv(WinFormEnvViewer.Factory); //or AvaloniaEnvViewer.Factory
bool done = true;
for (int i = 0; i < 100_000; i++)
{
    if (done)
    {
        NDArray observation = cp.Reset();
        done = false;
    }
    else
    {
        var (observation, reward, _done, information) = cp.Step((i % 2)); //we switch between moving left and right
        done = _done;
        //do something with the reward and observation.
    }

    SixLabors.ImageSharp.Image img = cp.Render(); //returns the image that was rendered.
    Thread.Sleep(15); //this is to prevent it from finishing instantly !
}

cp.Close();
```

## Roadmap
